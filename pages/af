Issues Found in Product Detail Pages
Yes, there are several issues! Here's what I found:

Critical Issues
File Name	Problem
tshirn.js	Typo - should be tshirt.js
hoodin.js	Typo - should be hoodie.js
stikrn.js	Typo - should be stickers.js
Mousepadn.js	Typo + inconsistent casing
mugs.js	✓ Correct
Why Links Still Work (For Now)
The category pages link to the misspelled URLs (/products/tshirn, /products/hoodin, etc.), so they accidentally work. But if users try to access /products/tshirt directly → 404 error.

Other Issues
Wrong Product Codes - All products use hoodie00X codes instead of their actual type:

tshirn.js  → code: "hoodie003" (should be "tshirt001")
stikrn.js  → code: "hoodie002" (should be "sticker001")
mugs.js    → code: "hoodie004" (should be "mug001")

Price Mismatch - Stickers category shows Rs:20 but product page shows Rs:30

Typo in Display - stikrn.js shows "Stikers" instead of "Stickers"

Unused Dynamic Route - [slug].js exists but isn't being used; each product has a hardcoded file

Impact
Direct URL access will fail with 404
Cart system may have issues due to incorrect product codes
Price confusion for customers
